## ⚛️ The React Quiz

<p>
This React application throws react-related questions to the user and each correct answer is worth a point, while the wrong answer is worth nothing. The application has a next-page functionality that moves to the next question. Additionally, there is a timer that counts down the time and ends the quiz once the time is up.
